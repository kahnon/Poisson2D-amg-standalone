# Poisson2D-amg-standalone
Standalone version of an algebraic multigrid (amg) solver for the axisymmetric 2D Poisson equation.  
An older project with lots of confusing code and questionable design choices.  
The code compiles without warnings/errors but I'm not completely sure if it works correctly.
